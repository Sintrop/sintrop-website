    "descriptionAbout": "Blockchain technology can positively impact the fight against climate change and social issues through smart contracts. However, decentralized blockchains process few transactions per second, forcing impact projects to compete with memecoins, NFTs, and low-value tokens, which increases gas fees and limits their operation. The proposed solution is a decentralized blockchain focused on socio-environmental impact, operating with a proof-of-work algorithm, seeking to operate with renewable energy.",

    "descriptionImpact": "We inherited a Planet with an incredible amount of life. Unfortunately, humanity has been destroying Nature at an alarming rate. Our goal is to build a system that fosters life on Earth through decentralized applications.",

    "descriptionDescentralization": "Decentralization as a core value means that we share the original vision of Bitcoin. The network is open and transparent, anyone with the appropriate hardware is welcome to run a node and maintain the network. Also, the token distribution is a key aspect. The Sintrop cryptocurrency, the native gas fees utility token of the project, will not be pre-mined, being the only way to mint new tokens with the reward per block when finding new blocks in the Proof-of-Work (PoW) system."
