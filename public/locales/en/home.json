    "descriptionAbstract": "Blockchain technology has the potential to significantly impact the fight against climate change and humanityâ€™s social problems, many different applications are possible to be built with smart contracts. The problem is that decentralized blockchains process very few transactions per second, so projects with real-world impact need to compete for transactions with memecoins, NFTs and others speculative low-value tokens and projects. This competition increases gas fees, limiting the number of impact business models able to operate. What is needed is a decentralized blockchain infrastructure focused on applications that can make the world better. We propose a public peer-to-peer impact blockchain, running with proof-of-work consensus algorithm with the aim of operating mostly with renewable energy.",
    "descriptionImpact": "We inherited a Planet with an incredible amount of life. Unfortunately, humanity has been destroying Nature at an alarming rate. Our goal is to build a system that fosters life on Earth through decentralized applications."
